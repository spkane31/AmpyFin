mode is switched between 'train', 'test', 'live'
'train' means running ranking_client.py and getting updated trading_simulator.
There will be an option to:
 - update your database if this is the data you want to insert into the database given better results during test
 - save this model to run testing before you decide to update your database
 - delete this model to start with a new model
'test' means running running your trained bot.
'live' means running your bot in live trading mode.
The default for both rank_mode and trade_mode is 'live'

time_delta_mode can be multiplicative, additive, or balanced. Additive results in less overfitting but could result in underfitting as time goes on
Multiplicative results in more overfitting but less underfitting as time goes on. Balanced results in a mix of both where time_delta is going to be a fifth of what the current timestamp is
and added to time_Delta so it is less overfitting and less underfitting as time goes on.
